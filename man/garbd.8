.SH NAME
garbd \- arbitrator daemon for Galera cluster

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B garbd
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,group address\/\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B garbd
joins Galera cluster as an additional node for the purpose of establishing
quorum in case of network partitioning. It can do so by serving:
.RS
a) as an odd node to prevent split-brains;
.RE
.RS
b) as a reference connection point outside a datacenter.
.RE
Arbitrator node must see all messages that the other nodes of the cluster
see, however it does not process them any further and just discards them.
As such it does not store any cluster state and can't be used to bootstrap
the cluster, so it only can join existing cluster.
